Solo Project Proposal
It's time to start putting your bootcamp skills to something you want to share with the world!

Begin by coming up with an idea, either from the listed wireframes, or your own design.  You should then build up a feature list for what you would want to include in the Presentation (Minimum Viable Product) and features that would be cool but not crucial (product backlog).
